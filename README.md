# CustomerAnalysis

Customer personality analysis is a thorough examination of a business' ideal clients. Businesses can more easily adjust products to the unique demands, inclinations, and concerns of various consumer types as a result of improved customer understanding.
Customer personality analysis enables firms to modify their offerings in response to target clients from various customer segments. For instance, the corporation might study which client segments are most likely to buy the product instead of paying money to sell a new product to every consumer in its database. Only that specific segment will be interested in the product, which can then be marketed to them.

From the data given (Customer analysis.csv) I have worked on:
1. Comprehensive report of the dataset and some of the important findings
2. Found type of customer is the most rewarding and their behaviour
3. Recommendation to the EDA
4. State impact from the recommendation

The presentation of the result can be found in CustAnalysis-Nabiilah Nuur A.pdf
